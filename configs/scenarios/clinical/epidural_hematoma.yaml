      19-year-old male, chief complaint: head injury, struck by baseball at batting practice.
      Had brief LOC at scene, then "lucid interval" — awake and conversant for ~45 minutes.
      Now rapidly deteriorating: GCS dropped from 14 to 7 over 10 minutes.
      Exam: left pupil 6mm fixed, right pupil 3mm reactive, right hemiparesis,
      decorticate posturing on right, Cushing triad developing (BP 178/60, HR 52).
      Vitals: BP 178/60, HR 52, RR 10 (irregular), SpO2 94%, Temp 37.0C.
      CT head: large left temporal epidural hematoma, 8mm midline shift, effacement of basal cisterns.
