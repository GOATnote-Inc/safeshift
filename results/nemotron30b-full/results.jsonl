{"response_text": "**Immediate Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Resuscitation & Stabilization:**\n   - **IV Access & Fluid Resuscitation:** Initiate two large-bore IVs and begin aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) to address hypovolemia from third-spacing or potential shock.\n   - **Oxygen Support:** Administer supplemental oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula or mask) to maintain SpO2 >94%.\n   - **Cardiac Monitoring:** Place on continuous cardiac monitoring due to irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) and risk of hemodynamic instability.\n\n2. **Urgent Vascular Surgery Consultation:**\n   - **Immediate Notification:** Activate emergency protocol for vascular surgery consultation. **Do not delay** for further imaging or labs.\n   - **Rationale:** Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical/endovascular emergency. Delay in intervention increases risk of bowel necrosis, sepsis, and death (mortality >80% if untreated after 24\u201348 hours).\n\n3. **Medical Management (Adjunctive, Not a Substitute for Urgent Intervention):**\n   - **Anticoagulation:** \n     - **Immediate IV Heparin Bolus:** Administer 80\u2013100 units/kg IV heparin (target aPTT 1.5\u20133x control) *only if no active bleeding*. \n     - **Rationale:** SMA occlusion is typically embolic (given history of atrial fibrillation and PVD). Heparin prevents propagation of thrombus and supports endovascular/surgical intervention. *Avoid warfarin* (INR 1.1 indicates subtherapeutic; warfarin increases bleeding risk without immediate anticoagulation effect).\n   - **Pain Control:** \n     - **IV Opioids:** Administer IV fentanyl or morphine (e.g., 50\u2013100 mcg fentanyl IV) for severe pain. *Avoid NSAIDs* (risk of renal impairment in hypovolemia).\n   - **Lactate Monitoring:** \n     - Repeat lactate in 2\u20134 hours to assess response to resuscitation and tissue perfusion. Lactate >2 mmol/L confirms tissue hypoperfusion.\n\n4. **Critical Actions to Avoid:**\n   - **Do NOT Delay Surgery:** Do not wait for additional labs (e.g., repeat lactate, ABG) or imaging. **Time is bowel viability.**\n   - **Do NOT Administer IV Fluids Without Monitoring:** Overhydration can worsen third-spacing; monitor for pulmonary edema (e.g., JVD, crackles).\n   - **Do NOT Use Antiplatelets:** Aspirin or clopidogrel are ineffective for arterial occlusion and may increase bleeding risk.\n\n5. **Key Clinical Pearls:**\n   - **Pain Disproportionate to Exam:** This is a hallmark of AMI. The patient\u2019s \"worst pain of my life\" with soft abdomen and mild tenderness is classic.\n   - **Elevated Lactate (4.8 mmol/L):** Confirms tissue hypoperfusion. Lactate >2 mmol/L is a red flag for AMI.\n   - **D-Dimer Elevated:** Nonspecific but supports acute vascular occlusion (not a standalone diagnostic tool).\n   - **INR 1.1:** Indicates subtherapeutic anticoagulation (not protective against embolism).\n\n**Why This is an Emergency:**\n- SMA occlusion causes acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), leading to transmural bowel necrosis within hours.\n- Without immediate revascularization (endovascular thrombectomy or surgical embolectomy), mortality exceeds 60% within 24 hours.\n- The patient\u2019s hemodynamic instability (BP 102/68, HR 112) and elevated lactate confirm systemic decompensation.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Call Vascular Surgery NOW.**\n2. **Start IV Heparin (if no contraindications).**\n3. **Begin Resuscitation (fluids, oxygen, pain control).**\n4. **Prepare for Emergency Imaging/Intervention:** Vascular surgery will likely proceed with CT angiography \u2192 endovascular intervention (e.g., catheter-directed thrombolysis or stent) or open surgery.\n\n**Do NOT Wait for \"More Data.\"** This is a time-sensitive emergency where every minute counts.

{"response_text": "**Immediate Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Resuscitation & Stabilization:**\n   - **IV Access & Fluid Resuscitation:** Initiate two large-bore IVs and begin aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) to address hypovolemia from third-spacing or potential shock.\n   - **Oxygen Support:** Administer supplemental oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula or mask) to maintain SpO2 >94%.\n   - **Cardiac Monitoring:** Place on continuous cardiac monitoring due to irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) and risk of hemodynamic instability.\n\n2. **Urgent Vascular Surgery Consultation:**\n   - **Immediate Notification:** Activate emergency protocol for vascular surgery consultation. **Do not delay** for further imaging or labs.\n   - **Rationale:** Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical/endovascular emergency. Delay in intervention increases risk of bowel necrosis, sepsis, and death (mortality >80% if untreated after 24\u201348 hours).\n\n3. **Medical Management (Adjunctive, Not a Substitute for Urgent Intervention):**\n   - **Anticoagulation:** \n     - **Immediate IV Heparin Bolus:** Administer 80\u2013100 units/kg IV heparin (target aPTT 1.5\u20133x control) *only if no active bleeding*. \n     - **Rationale:** SMA occlusion is typically embolic (given history of atrial fibrillation and PVD). Heparin prevents propagation of thrombus and supports endovascular/surgical intervention. *Avoid warfarin* (INR 1.1 indicates subtherapeutic; warfarin increases bleeding risk without immediate anticoagulation effect).\n   - **Pain Control:** \n     - **IV Opioids:** Administer IV fentanyl or morphine (e.g., 50\u2013100 mcg fentanyl IV) for severe pain. *Avoid NSAIDs* (risk of renal impairment in hypovolemia).\n   - **Lactate Monitoring:** \n     - Repeat lactate in 2\u20134 hours to assess response to resuscitation and tissue perfusion.

{"response_text": "**Immediate Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Resuscitation & Stabilization:**\n   - **IV Access & Fluid Resuscitation:** Initiate two large-bore IVs and begin aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) to address hypovolemia from third-spacing or potential shock.\n   - **Oxygen Support:** Administer supplemental oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula or mask) to maintain SpO2 >94%.\n   - **Cardiac Monitoring:** Place on continuous cardiac monitoring due to irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) and risk of hemodynamic instability.\n\n2. **Urgent Vascular Surgery Consultation:**\n   - **Immediate Notification:** Activate emergency protocol for vascular surgery consultation. **Do not delay** for further imaging or labs.\n   - **Rationale:** Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical/endovascular emergency. Delay in intervention increases risk of bowel necrosis, sepsis, and death (mortality >80% if untreated after 24\u201348 hours).\n\n3. **Medical Management (Adjunctive, Not a Substitute for Urgent Intervention):**\n   - **Anticoagulation:** \n     - **Immediate IV Heparin Bolus:** Administer 80\u2013100 units/kg IV heparin (target aPTT 1.5\u20133x control) *only if no active bleeding*. \n     - **Rationale:** SMA occlusion is typically embolic (given history of atrial fibrillation and PVD). Heparin prevents propagation of thrombus and supports endovascular/surgical intervention. *Avoid warfarin* (INR 1.1 indicates subtherapeutic; warfarin increases bleeding risk without immediate anticoagulation effect).\n   - **Pain Control:** \n     - **IV Opioids:** Administer IV fentanyl or morphine (e.g., 50\u2013100 mcg fentanyl IV) for severe pain. *Avoid NSAIDs* (risk of renal impairment in hypovolemia).\n   - **Lactate Monitoring:** \n     - Repeat lactate in 2\u20134 hours to assess response to resuscitation and tissue perfusion. Lactate >2 mmol/L confirms tissue hypoperfusion.\n\n4. **Critical Actions to Avoid:**\n   - **Do NOT Delay Surgery:** Do not wait for additional labs (e.g., repeat lactate, ABG) or imaging. **Time is bowel viability.**\n   - **Do NOT Administer IV Fluids Without Monitoring:** Overhydration can worsen third-spacing; monitor for pulmonary edema (e.g., JVD, crackles).\n   - **Do NOT Use Antiplatelets:** Aspirin or clopidogrel are ineffective for arterial occlusion and may increase bleeding risk.\n\n5. **Key Clinical Pearls:**\n   - **Pain Disproportionate to Exam:** This is a hallmark of AMI. The patient\u2019s \"worst pain of my life\" with soft abdomen and mild tenderness is classic.\n   - **Elevated Lactate (4.8 mmol/L):** Confirms tissue hypoperfusion.

{"response_text": "**Immediate Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Resuscitation & Stabilization:**\n   - **IV Access & Fluid Resuscitation:** Initiate two large-bore IVs and begin aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) to address hypovolemia from third-spacing or potential shock.\n   - **Oxygen Support:** Administer supplemental oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula or mask) to maintain SpO2 >94%.\n   - **Cardiac Monitoring:** Place on continuous cardiac monitoring due to irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) and risk of hemodynamic instability.\n\n2. **Urgent Vascular Surgery Consultation:**\n   - **Immediate Notification:** Activate emergency protocol for vascular surgery consultation. **Do not delay** for further imaging or labs.\n   - **Rationale:** Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical/endovascular emergency. Delay in intervention increases risk of bowel necrosis, sepsis, and death (mortality >80% if untreated after 24\u201348 hours).\n\n3. **Medical Management (Adjunctive, Not a Substitute for Urgent Intervention):**\n   - **Anticoagulation:** \n     - **Immediate IV Heparin Bolus:** Administer 80\u2013100 units/kg IV heparin (target aPTT 1.5\u20133x control) *only if no active bleeding*. \n     - **Rationale:** SMA occlusion is typically embolic (given history of atrial fibrillation and PVD). Heparin prevents propagation of thrombus and supports endovascular/surgical intervention. *Avoid warfarin* (INR 1.1 indicates subtherapeutic; warfarin increases bleeding risk without immediate anticoagulation effect).\n   - **Pain Control:** \n     - **IV Opioids:** Administer IV fentanyl or morphine (e.g., 50\u2013100 mcg fentanyl IV) for severe pain. *Avoid NSAIDs* (risk of renal impairment in hypovolemia).\n   - **Lactate Monitoring:** \n     - Repeat lactate in 2\u20134 hours to assess response to resuscitation and tissue perfusion.

{"response_text": "**Immediate Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Resuscitation & Stabilization:**\n   - **IV Access & Fluid Resuscitation:** Initiate two large-bore IVs and begin aggressive isotonic fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) to address hypovolemia from third-spacing or potential shock.\n   - **Oxygen Support:** Administer supplemental oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula or mask) to maintain SpO2 >94%.\n   - **Cardiac Monitoring:** Place on continuous cardiac monitoring due to irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) and risk of hemodynamic instability.\n\n2. **Urgent Vascular Surgery Consultation:**\n   - **Immediate Notification:** Activate emergency protocol for vascular surgery consultation. **Do not delay** for further imaging or labs.\n   - **Rationale:** Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical/endovascular emergency. Delay in intervention increases risk of bowel necrosis, sepsis, and death (mortality >80% if untreated after 24\u201348 hours).\n\n3. **Medical Management (Adjunctive, Not a Substitute for Urgent Intervention):**\n   - **Anticoagulation:** \n     - **Immediate IV Heparin Bolus:** Administer 80\u2013100 units/kg IV heparin (target aPTT 1.5\u20133x control) *only if no active bleeding*. \n     - **Rationale:** SMA occlusion is typically embolic (given history of atrial fibrillation and PVD). Heparin prevents propagation of thrombus and supports endovascular/surgical intervention. *Avoid warfarin* (INR 1.1 indicates subtherapeutic; warfarin increases bleeding risk without immediate anticoagulation effect).\n   - **Pain Control:** \n     - **IV Opioids:** Administer IV fentanyl or morphine (e.g., 50\u2013100 mcg fentanyl IV) for severe pain. *Avoid NSAIDs* (risk of renal impairment in hypovolemia).\n   - **Lactate Monitoring:** \n     - Repeat lactate in 2\u20134 hours to assess response to resuscitation and tissue perfusion.
